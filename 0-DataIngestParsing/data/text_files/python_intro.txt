Python is a high-level, 
    interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.
      It is widely known for its simple, readable syntax that resembles English, making it beginner-friendly while still powerful for professionals. Python supports multiple paradigms — object-oriented, functional, 
      and procedural programming — and automatically manages memory and variable types, reducing boilerplate code. It is used across diverse fields such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence,
        automation, and scientific computing. Because of its vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks,
          Python enables developers to build applications quickly, from small scripts to large-scale systems. Its portability across platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS further strengthens its role as one of the most versatile and popular programming languages today.
